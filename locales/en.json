      "After six years spent in the historic district of La Doutre in Angers, we chose in December 2023 to cross the Maine River and open a new place, a place that reflects us more deeply.",
      "In September 2025, a year and a half after settling in, a major water damage incident abruptly brought everything to a halt. This sudden interruption forced us to refocus, rethink our organization, and strengthen the identity of our house.",
      "Our new home, an elegant brick building, was transformed with heightened attention. Every detail, every space, every atmosphere now fully reflects our personality and vision.",

        "Early on, she felt the need to open herself to the world. She spent three years in England working in dining rooms, developing confidence and a strong sense of hospitality.",
        "She then continued her journey between Saint-Barthélemy and Courchevel, serving an exacting international clientele. These experiences shaped a precise, ambitious personality driven by attention to detail."

      "name": "Gaëtan Morvan",

        "Born in Angers, Gaëtan entered the kitchen at 15 through an apprenticeship at L’Hoirie. After earning a culinary degree and a dessert specialization, he naturally pursued excellence.",
        "Michel Guérard offered him his first major opportunity. He later joined Alain Ducasse at Le Louis XV in Monaco, where he discovered total discipline and uncompromising standards.",
        "His journey continued with Laurent Saudeau and then at SaQuaNa in Honfleur, influenced by a refined Japanese-inspired cuisine focused on purity and essentials."
      ]

    "closing": [
      "When Fanny and Gaëtan met, the connection was immediate. Very quickly, they left everything behind to travel to Shanghai and take part in the opening of a Michelin-starred chef’s restaurant.",
      "In 2017, Lait Thym Sel was born. From the very beginning, every dish and every menu has been conceived together.",
      "Today, they fully reunite as a duo in the kitchen, side by side, more united than ever. A natural continuation for a house built with four hands, precision, and a shared identity."
